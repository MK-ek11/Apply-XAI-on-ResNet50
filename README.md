# Implementation of XAI method on ResNet50
## Description
Course: Machine Learning (Fall 2022) <br />
Task: Generate explanations for the classification results by ResNet50 using Grad-CAM and LIME. Implement with **https://keras.io/examples/vision/grad_cam/** and **https://github.com/marcotcr/lime**
  
  
Pre-trained model that was used:  
- ResNet50 Model


Explanation AI used:  
- Grad-CAM
- LIME


### Analysis:
The Grad-CAM highlights the localized areas on the image that contributes positively to the model’s classification. <br />
The LIME explanation method visualizes the contribution of each feature of an image to the model’s classification. <br />
Conclusion, that the ResNet50 model can correctly identify and focus on the right areas of the image to make its classification
